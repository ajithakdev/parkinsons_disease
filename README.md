# Parkinson's Disease Detection

>> **Project Title:** Parkinson's Disease Early Prediction and Guidance Using Machine Learning

**Description:**
This project aims to develop a web application that can predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease in individuals based on various voice characteristics and provide guidance for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

**Technologies Used:**
1. Python: The primary programming language for the machine learning model and Streamlit app.
2. Streamlit: A Python library for building interactive web applications.
3. scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. NumPy: A library for numerical computing.
5. pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
6. streamlit-option-menu: A Streamlit component for creating option menus.

**Project Structure:**
1. `WebApp.py`: The main script containing the Streamlit app code, including the user interface, prediction logic, and page content.
2. `predictive_system.py`: (Optional) Additional functions or scripts related to the machine learning model and predictions.
3. `trained_model.sav`: The saved trained machine learning model.
4. `parkinsons.csv`: The dataset containing voice recordings and features for Parkinson's disease prediction.
5. `requirements.txt`: (Optional) A file listing the required Python libraries for the project.
6. `Dockerfile`: (Optional) A file used for containerizing the app and its dependencies using Docker.

**Features:**
1. **Prediction:** Users can input data through a user-friendly interface, and the app will predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on the provided voice characteristics.
2. **Guidance:** If the prediction is negative, the app redirects users to a page with tips and resources for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
3. **About Parkinson's:** The app provides information about Parkinson's disease, its symptoms, and prevention strategies.
4. **Contact Us:** Users can submit their contact information and messages through a simple form.

**Installation and Usage:**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required libraries (using requirements.txt or manually).
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run WebApp.py`
4. Access the app in your web browser at the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501).

**Deployment:**
1. The app can be deployed to various platforms like Streamlit Sharing or Heroku, or containerized using Docker for more complex environments.

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Integrate more advanced visualizations, such as interactive charts and graphs.
2. Include guidance and resources specific to Parkinson's disease for positive predictions.
3. Implement more robust input validation and error handling.
4. Develop personalized recommendations and progress tracking features.
5. Explore the use of other machine learning models and feature engineering techniques.

**Contribution:**
1. Feel free to contribute to the project by submitting issues, suggesting improvements, or creating pull requests.
