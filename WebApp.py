Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also may cause stiffness or slowing of movement.
In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.
Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, a health care professional may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.

<b style='font-size: 24px;'>Symptoms</b>

- **Tremor:** Rhythmic shaking, called tremor, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are performing tasks.

- **Slowed movement (bradykinesia):** Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk.

- **Rigid muscles:** Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.

- **Impaired posture and balance:** Your posture may become stooped. Or you may fall or have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease.

- **Loss of automatic movements:** You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling, or swinging your arms when you walk.

- **Speech changes:** You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns.

- **Writing changes:** It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.


<b style='font-size: 24px;'>When to see a doctor:</b><br>
See a health care professional if you have any of the symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease \xe2\x80\x94 not only to diagnose your condition but also to rule out other causes for your symptoms.

  <b style='font-size: 24px;'>Prevention</b><br>
There are no proven ways to prevent the disease.

Some research has shown that regular aerobic exercise might reduce the risk of Parkinson's disease.

Some other research has shown that people who consume caffeine \xe2\x80\x94 which is found in coffee, tea and cola \xe2\x80\x94 get Parkinson's disease less often than those who don't drink it. Green tea also is related to a reduced risk of developing Parkinson's disease. However, it is still not known whether caffeine protects against getting Parkinson's or is related in some other way. Currently there is not enough evidence to suggest that drinking caffeinated beverages protects against Parkinson's.
